# AddressBook-2
This is an app that uses a GUI and SQL database for a simple address book.
This is possibly the Final version of this project that Jennifer Bunte and I have been working on together.
We took a simple class project that was an address book which drew the information to fill the address book
from a text file and displayed the information onto the console of our IDE.
We then created a GUI which still drew from the text file.
Next we changed the text file to a SQL database.
Then we validated all the user input and now have the appropriate pop boxes appear if the user inputs something 
incorrectly as well as if they input correctly.
The user is able to List all the names, email addresses, and phone numbers in the address book.
The user is also able to Add, Update and Delete to the address book
